# NodeJS: Everything's a Module

## Introduction
This is a sample folder for a presentation for the Lodgable development team.

The presentation will cover each of the following steps.  You can follow along, or play around with it independently.

### Prerequisites
To use these examples, you must have the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine.

This presentation is designed for those who have at least a basic understanding of JavaScript.

A good amount of this presentation will be in the console, and being comfortable while navigating in the console is recommended.

To start, clone this repo onto your computer, then from the root of this project, type in `npm start`.
