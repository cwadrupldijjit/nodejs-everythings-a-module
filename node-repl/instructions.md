### Node REPL
Node comes with a built-in command-line REPL (which is short for Read Evaluate Print Loop), similar to the console in browsers.  Inside of a REPL, you can type in code and have it execute.

To try it out, go to the console and type in:
```shell
node
```

After that, your prompt should look different, going to the next line and printing a `> `.  You then are in the REPL.  Any valid JavaScript code can run in this context.

Suggestions of what you can do are:
  * `'Hello, World!'`
  * `console.log('Hello, World!')`
  * `var foo = 2` then `foo * 4`
  * `['x', 3, function() {console.log('freddy')}]`
